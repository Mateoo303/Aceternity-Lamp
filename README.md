This is a modified version of `Lamp effect` from Aceternity UI by [Manu Arora](https://github.com/manuarora700)

## Previous Problem
- Adding content to `LampContainer` made lamp completly layout shift from it's container, so glow was cut off.

## Changes
- Adding more content to `LampContainer` doesn't shift whole layout anymore.

## Usage
Copy `Lamp.tsx` in `/components` to your project. You can check out how it works now in example `/app/page.tsx`.

## Bug Fixes
Please report and bugs in *issues* section
